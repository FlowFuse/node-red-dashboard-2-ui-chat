# Chat Window Widget for FlowFuse Dashboard (Node-RED Dashboard 2.0)

This repository contains a third-party, node for the Node-RED Dashboard to provide an interactive chat window widget.

Easily build a chat-based user interface, and seamlessly integrate it with the vast collection of other Node-RED nodes available, including many for well-known AI services and offerings like [OpenAI](https://flows.nodered.org/node/@inductiv/node-red-openai-api) or [ollama](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-ollama).

Below is a demonstration of the chat widget in action, integrated with an OpenAI node to provide a chatbot interface, one trained on 

## Examples

### OpenAI Chatbot

Here, an OpenAI agent was prompted that it is an expert in Node-RED, and should assist users with flow-building and answering general questions:

### Chat & Worldmap Integration

This agent was provisioned to provide coordinate data alongside it's text-based answers, which are then rendered onto a World Map, also rendered within FlowFuse Dashboard.

Anything sent into the node will be considered as a _received_ message. Any messages typed into the chat will be sent out of the node as a _sent_ message.

#### Predefined Input Types

You can create placeholder items in your chat, like a "Typing" message by using different `msg.topic` values.

##### "Typing" Placeholder

By assigning a `msg.topic` of `_typing`, then a placeholder "Typing..." message will be shown in the chat. This is automatically removed when the next message is received.


##### Defining Message Authors

Any other `msg.topic` values used are assumed to be the name of the "author" of the message.
